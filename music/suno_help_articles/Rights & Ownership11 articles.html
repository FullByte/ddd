Well... let's talk about it.</p><p>If you made your songs while subscribed to a <strong class="kb-bold">Pro</strong> or <strong class="kb-bold">Premier</strong> plan, those songs are covered by a commercial use license. This allows you to distribute songs to Spotify, Apple Music, etc, using the distributor of your choice. This also allows you to use the songs in content you post to YouTube, TikTok, etc. You don't have to attribute the songs to Suno, but we wouldn't mind if you let your audience know we helped you create your masterpiece!</p><p>Songs made under the <strong class="kb-bold">Basic</strong> (free) tier are only available for non-commercial use and cannot be monetized. These do not include the commercial use license, and starting a subscription after you made a great song will <strong class="kb-bold">not</strong> give you a retroactive license for the song. If you plan on monetizing the music you make with Suno, check out our plan options <a class="kb-link kb-link" href="https://suno.com/account" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><strong class="kb-bold">here</strong></a>.</p><blockquote class="kb-blockquote"><p>Pro Tip: As with any time you monetize your songs, you <strong class="kb-bold">must</strong> be the owner of 100% of the material. Don't try to monetize a song if you're using someone else's lyrics! This can lead to your YouTube channel getting shut down, distributors blacklisting your future releases, etc.</p></blockquote></div><div class="article-attachment-wrapper"></div><div class="article-keywords-wrapper"><div class="article-keyword">distribution</div><div class="article-keyword">spotify</div><div class="article-keyword">apple</div><div class="article-keyword">rights</div><div class="article-keyword">owner</div></div></div><h2>Can I register my songs with my region's copyright office</h2><div class="article-content-container"><h1 class="article-title">Can I register my songs with my region's copyright office?</h1><div class="article-sub-title" data-edited="1721856303724" data-id="37789761" id="article-edited">Edited<noscript> Wednesday, July 24 2024</noscript></div><div class="article-content"><p>Copyright law can vary from region to region, and the rules are still being refined for copyrighting works that were created with AI.</p><p>As such, we recognize that the availability and scope of copyright protection for content generated (in whole or in part) using artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and varies among countries.

To ensure you have the most up-to-date information, we suggest reaching your local copyright office before applying. </p><p>It is important to know there is a difference between <strong class="kb-bold">ownership</strong> and <strong class="kb-bold">copyrights</strong>. It is often said that if you come up with something on your own, you automatically assume the rights to it. In music, there are several other factors that help determine rights beyond ownership.</p><p>Relating to Suno:</p><ul><li><p>If you make music with the <strong class="kb-bold">Basic</strong> (free) plan, <strong class="kb-bold">Suno</strong> is the owner of the songs. You are allowed to use the songs for <strong class="kb-bold">non-commerical purposes</strong>.</p></li><li><p>If you make songs while subscribed to the <strong class="kb-bold">Pro</strong> or <strong class="kb-bold">Premier</strong> plan, <strong class="kb-bold">you</strong> own the songs. Further, you are granted a commercial use license to monetize those songs.</p></li></ul><p>In both cases, however, the material may <em>not</em> be eligible for <strong class="kb-bold">copyright protection</strong>. </p><p>In the US, copyright laws protect material created by a human. Music made 100% with AI would not qualify for copyright protection because a human did not write the lyrics or the music. Writing the prompt does not constitute the creation of the song. </p><p>If you wrote the lyrics for your song(s), you own those lyrics. Most copyright offices will allow you to register those lyrics on their own, and you may be able to use those lyrics to register your whole song as well. Some regions/registrars may recognize you as the writer of the song and Suno as an instrument to help you create the song. If this happens, the song will likely be eligible for copyright protection. </p><p>In any case, if you made songs while subscribed to Pro or Premier, you should be the <strong class="kb-bold">only</strong> person that is allowed to monetize those songs through distribution or other channels. Some distributors exclude songs that are not eligible for copyright protection, so it may be helpful to research several options, and as always, <strong class="kb-bold">read the terms and conditions</strong>!</p><p></p></div><div class="article-attachment-wrapper"></div><div class="article-keywords-wrapper"><div class="article-keyword">copyright</div><div class="article-keyword">protection</div><div class="article-keyword">ownership</div><div class="article-keyword">writer</div><div class="article-keyword">owner</div></div></div><h2>Does Suno own the music I make</h2><div class="article-content-container"><h1 class="article-title">Does Suno own the music I make?</h1><div class="article-sub-title" data-edited="1721669545311" data-id="37372993" id="article-edited">Edited<noscript> Monday, July 22 2024</noscript></div><div class="article-content"><p>We know that ownership of your material is important, and it's helpful to know exactly where you stand before you take the next steps with your songs!
