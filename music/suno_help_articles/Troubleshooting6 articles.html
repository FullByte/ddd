If you've used a connected account, start by tapping on the icon for the service you chose. If you're unsure which service you used, tap your most likely option. </p><p>If you select <strong class="kb-bold">Apple</strong> but <strong class="kb-bold"><em>do not</em></strong> have an associated Suno account, the message <strong class="kb-bold">Create an account for Suno - Make Music using your Apple ID "youremail@email.com" </strong>will appear<strong class="kb-bold"> </strong>with options to share or hide your email, and continue with your Apple ID passcode. This is how to create a new account, so you would have logged in with a different method previously!</p><p>Login via <strong class="kb-bold">Google</strong>, however, is different. Even if you haven't created an account, once you choose an email address and choose Continue, you will either log into an existing account or create a new account. </p><p>In any case, if you do not see your previous songs in your Library, there's a good chance you have more than one account. Contact our team at <a class="kb-link kb-link" href="mailto:support@suno.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">support@suno.com</a> so we can help you navigate and recover your account details. We can also help you merge accounts if you have songs in two or more accounts!</p><p></p></div><div class="article-attachment-wrapper"></div></div><h2>I can't log in with my phone number!</h2><div class="article-content-container"><h1 class="article-title">I can't log in with my phone number!</h1><div class="article-sub-title" data-edited="1723040661462" data-id="40070081" id="article-edited">Edited<noscript> Wednesday, August 7 2024</noscript></div><div class="article-content"><p>Are you having trouble logging in with a phone number? Our team is here to help!</p><p>There are two common issues with logging in with a phone number:</p><ul><li><p>You enter a number but never receive an OTP (one-time passcode)</p></li><li><p>You attempt to log in but receive an error about being from a restricted region</p></li></ul><p>Both of these can be resolved by reaching our team at <a class="kb-link kb-link" href="mailto:support@suno.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">support@suno.com</a>! </p><p>Before we get there, it's important to stress that we <strong class="kb-bold"><em>do not</em></strong><em> </em>want to restrict you from making music. A restriction in certain regions could be in place due to an uptick in suspicious or unusual activity, and is often not permanent. We take your account security seriously, and these can be helpful in keeping all Suno users safe!</p><p>For transparency, a solution will likely involve setting up a new account using one of our four connected login methods: <strong class="kb-bold">Apple</strong>, <strong class="kb-bold">Discord</strong>, <strong class="kb-bold">Google</strong>, and <strong class="kb-bold">Windows</strong>. This allows you to use Login via Google, for example, and and use the same email/password combination as if you were checking your email. If you ever need to change a password, you'd do it directly with the service, not through Suno.</p><p>After setting up your new account, our team can help with moving any existing music and credits to your new account so you can access your songs and keep making music!</p></div><div class="article-attachment-wrapper"></div><div class="article-keywords-wrapper"><div class="article-keyword">login</div><div class="article-keyword">error</div><div class="article-keyword">troubleshooting</div><div class="article-keyword">phone</div><div class="article-keyword">blocked</div></div></div><h2>Something isn't working.
